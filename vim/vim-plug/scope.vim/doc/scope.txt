1. Overview					*scope-overview*

Map the following functions to your favorite keys.

In the following examples, replace `<your_key>` with the desired key
combination.

Find File ~

Find files in the current working directory. Files are retrieved through an
external job, and the window seamlessly refreshes to display real-time
results.
>
	vim9script
	import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.File()<cr>
<
[!NOTE]
If you are using legacy script to map keys, use:
>
	`nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>vim9cmd scope#fuzzy#File()<cr>`

If you're not concerned with customizing the behavior, another option is to
simply map keys to commands (see below).

Search for installed Vim files.
>
	vim9script
	import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.File("find " .. $VIMRUNTIME .. " -type f -print -follow")<cr>
<
Use [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) instead of `find` command.
>
	vim9script
	import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.File('fd -tf --follow')<cr>
<
API ~
>
	# findCmd: String     : Command string to search for files. If omitted or set to
	#                      'null_string', uses 'find' command.
	# count: Number       : Maximum number of files returned.
	# ignore_err: Boolean : Ignore stderr from 'findCmd', including file permission errors.
	def File(findCmd: string = null_string, count: number = 100000, ignore_err: bool = true)
<
> [!NOTE]
> If the `findCmd` argument (above) is either unset or set to `null_string`,
> the find command (accessible from $PATH)) is automatically utilized.
> Under this circumstance, the following conditions apply:
>       - Patterns specified in the Vim option 'wildignore', along with
>       patterns present in files '.gitignore' and '~/.gitignore', are
>       excluded. For instance, to prevent the find command from traversing
>       into the `.foo` directory or displaying Vim swap files, add the
>       following line to your .vimrc file: `set wildignore+=.foo/*,*.swp`.
>       `.git` directory is automatically excluded.
>       - If the `.gitignore` file contains `**` or `!` within the patterns,
>       the performance of the find command may deteriorate. If this becomes
>       problematic, consider using [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd).
>       - For guidance on setting wildignore patterns, refer to `:h
>       autocmd-patterns` within Vim. For similar assistance regarding
>       gitignore patterns, consult '[PATTERN
>       FORMAT](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)'.

> [!NOTE]
> To echo the command string in Vim's command line, set the option
> `find_echo_cmd` to `true`. Default is `false`. Setting this option helps in
> debugging arguments given to find command. Setting of options is discussed
> later.

Live Grep ~

Live grep in the directory.
>
	vim9script
	import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.Grep()<cr>
<
> [!NOTE]
> 1. To perform a second grep with the same keyword, there's no need to retype
>    it. The prompt conveniently retains the previous grep string as virtual
>    text. Simply input `<Right>` or `<PgDn>` to auto-fill and proceed, or
>    overwrite it as needed. For smaller projects, you can efficiently execute
>    repeated greps without relying on the quickfix list.
> 2. Special characters can be entered into the prompt window directly without
>    requiring backslash escaping.
> 3. When working with live grep, it can be advantageous to suspend it
>    temporarily and refine the results through filtering. Press `<C-k>` to
>    enter pattern search mode. For instance, while in pattern search mode,
>    typing `^foo` will selectively display lines starting with `foo`. To
>    negate patterns, prepend `!` to the search term. For instance, to filter
>    lines that do not contain `foo` or `bar`, input `!foo|bar` into the
>    prompt. Whether the pattern is case-sensitive is determined by
>    `ignorecase` Vim option. To force case (in)sensitive search prepend the
>    pattern with `\c` or `\C`. Pressing `<C-k>` again will toggle back to
>    live grep mode.

Define your own grep command.
>
	vim9script
	import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
	# Case sensitive grep
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.Grep('grep --color=never -REIHns --exclude-dir=.git')<cr>
	# ripgrep
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.Grep('rg --vimgrep --no-heading --smart-case')<cr>
	# silvergrep
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.Grep('ag --vimgrep')<cr>
	# Search the word under cursor
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.Grep(null_string, true, '<cword>')<cr>
<
`grep` command string is echoed in the command line after each search. You can
set an option to turn this off (see below).

API ~
>
 	# grepCmd: String : Command string as you'd use in a shell. If omitted, uses 'grep'
 	#                       and excludes paths specified in 'wildignore'.
	# ignorecase: Boolean : Strictly for syntax highlighting. Should match the 'ignorecase'
	#                       option given to 'grep'.
	# cword: String : If not null_string, put the word under cursor into the prompt.
	#                 Allowable values are '<cword>' and '<cWORD>'.
	def Grep(grepCmd: string = null_string, ignorecase: bool = true, cword: string = null_string)
<
If the `grepCmd` argument (above) is either not set or set to `null_string`,
the grep command (accessible from $PATH) is automatically utilized. In this
scenario, patterns specified in the Vim option 'wildignore' are automatically
excluded from grep operations. For example, to prevent the grep command from
traversing into the `.foo` directory, include the following line in your
.vimrc file: `set wildignore+=.foo/*`. Any pattern within 'wildignore'
containing a slash (`/`) is interpreted as a directory (utilizing grep option
--exclude-dir), while others are considered as files (utilizing grep option
--exclude). `.git` directory is always excluded.

To optimize responsiveness, consider fine-tuning `Grep()` settings,
particularly for larger projects and slower systems. For instance, adjusting
`timer_delay` to a higher value can help alleviate jitteriness during fast
typing or clipboard pasting. Additionally, `grep_poll_interval` dictates the
initial responsiveness of the prompt for the first few typed characters.

Here's a breakdown of available options:

`grep_poll_interval` 		`Number`. Controls how frequently the pipe (of
				    spawned job) is checked and results are
				    displayed. Specified in milliseconds.
				    Default: `20`.
`timer_delay` 			`Number`. Delay (in milliseconds) before executing
				    the grep command. Default: `20`.
`grep_throttle_len` 		`Number`. Grep command is terminated after
				    `grep_poll_interval` if the typed
				    characters are below this threshold.
				    Default: `3`.
`grep_skip_len` 		`Number`. Specifies the minimum number of
				    characters required to invoke the grep
				    command. Default: `0`.
`grep_echo_cmd` 		`Boolean`. Determines whether to display the grep
				    command string on the command line.
				    Default: `true`.

To optimize performance, adjust these options accordingly:
>
    scope#fuzzy#OptionsSet({
        grep_echo_cmd: false,
        # ...
    })
<
or
>
    import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
    fuzzy.OptionsSet({
        grep_echo_cmd: false,
        # ...
    })

Switch Buffer ~

Switching buffers becomes effortless with fuzzy search. When no input is
provided, it automatically selects the alternate buffer.
>
	vim9script
	import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.Buffer()<cr>
<
Search unlisted buffers as well.
>
	vim9script
	import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.Buffer(true)<cr>
<
Hide unlisted buffers and always use current window
>
	vim9script
	import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.Buffer(v:none, false)<cr>
<
API ~
>
	# list_all_buffers: Boolean : If 'true', include unlisted buffers as well.
	# goto_window: Boolean : If 'false', do not go to other window.
	def Buffer(list_all_buffers: bool = false, goto_window: bool = true )

Search Current Buffer ~

Enter a word in the prompt, and it will initiate a fuzzy search within the
current buffer. The prompt conveniently displays the word under the cursor
(`<cword>`) or the previously searched word as virtual text. Use `<Right>` or
`<PgDn>` to auto-fill and continue, or type over it.
>
	vim9script
	import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.BufSearch()<cr>
	# Search the word under cursor
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.BufSearch('<cword>')<cr>

API ~
>
	# cword: String : If not null_string, put the word under cursor into the prompt.
	#                 Allowable values are '<cword>' and '<cWORD>'.
	# recall: Boolean : Put previously searched word or <cword> into the prompt.
	def BufSearch(cword: string = null_string, recall: bool = true)

Quickfix and Location List Integration ~

While the popup window is open, you can conveniently send all items
(unfiltered) to a quickfix list by typing `<C-q>`. For filtered items, utilize
`<C-Q>`. Likewise, to direct items to the location list, simply type `<C-l>`
or `<C-L>`.

Vim conveniently retains the ten most recently used quickfix and location
lists for each window. When creating a new quickfix or location list, you can
choose to either append it to the end of the stack or replace existing entries
with new ones. This behavior is controlled by the `quickfix_stack` option
(described below), which can be set using `fuzzy.OptionsSet()`.

`quickfix_stack` 		`Boolean`. If `true` a new quickfix list (or
				location list) is created at the end of the
				stack and entries are added. Otherwise,
				replace existing entries in the current
				quickfix list (or location list) with new
				entries. Default: `true`.

File list (`File()`), grep (`Grep()`), buffer list (`Buffer()`), word search
in a buffer (`BufSearch()`), and git file list (`GitFile()`) provide formatted
output containing filename information (and line numbers when available),
facilitating seamless navigation. Other fuzzy search commands can also send
output to the quickfix or location list, although their utility may be
limited.

You have the option to display the contents of the current quickfix or
location list in a popup menu for efficient fuzzy searching and navigation.
Use the following mappings:
>
	vim9script
	import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.Quickfix()<cr>
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.Loclist()<cr>

The current item (error) is highlighted with an asterisk. You can also
navigate to the next error in the list by using the `:cnext` command instead
of the popup window.

The entire stack of quickfix and location lists can be displayed in a popup
window. Use the following mappings:
>
	vim9script
	import autoload 'scope/fuzzy.vim'
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.QuickfixHistory()<cr>
	nnoremap <your_key> <scriptcmd>fuzzy.LoclistHistory()<cr>

After selecting a list from the popup menu of `fuzzy.QuickfixHistory()` or
`fuzzy.LoclistHistory()`, you can automatically open the quickfix or
location-list window. Add the following autocmd group:
>
	augroup scope-quickfix-history
	    autocmd!
	    autocmd QuickFixCmdPost chistory cwindow
	autocmd QuickFixCmdPost lhistory lwindow
	augroup END

For automatic quickfix or location list window opening after `<C-q>` or
`<C-l>` commands, replace `chistory|lhistory` above with `clist|llist`.

All Functions ~

You can map the following functions to keys.

`fuzzy.Autocmd()`: Vim autocommands, go to their declaration on `<cr>`
`fuzzy.BufSearch()`: Words in current buffer
`fuzzy.Buffer()`: Open buffers (option to search 'unlisted' buffers)
`fuzzy.CmdHistory()`: Command history
`fuzzy.Colorscheme()`: Available color schemes
`fuzzy.Command()`: Vim commands
`fuzzy.File()`: Files in current working directory
`fuzzy.Filetype()`: File types
`fuzzy.GitFile()`: Files under git
`fuzzy.Grep()`: Live grep in current working directory (spaces allowed)
`fuzzy.Help()`: Help topics
`fuzzy.HelpfilesGrep()`: Live grep Vim help files (doc/*.txt)
`fuzzy.Highlight()`: Highlight groups
`fuzzy.Jumplist()`: `:h jumplist`
`fuzzy.Keymap()`: Key mappings, go to their declaration on `<cr>`
`fuzzy.LspDocumentSymbol()`: Symbols supplied by (yegappan) Lsp client
`fuzzy.Loclist()`: Items in the location list (sets 'current entry')
`fuzzy.LoclistHistory()`: Entries in the location list stack
`fuzzy.MRU()`: `:h v:oldfiles`
`fuzzy.Mark()`: Vim marks (`:h mark-motions`)
`fuzzy.Option()`: Vim options and their values
`fuzzy.Quickfix()`: Items in the quickfix list (sets 'current entry') 
`fuzzy.QuickfixHistory()`: Entries in the quickfix list stack
`fuzzy.Register()`: Vim registers, paste contents on `<cr>`
`fuzzy.Tag()`: `:h ctags` search
`fuzzy.Window()`: Open windows

Commands ~

The above functions have equivalent commands that can be invoked from the
command line. The primary command is `:Scope`, with the function name as its
only argument except for `Grep`. These commands are primarily provided for
convenience. The main interface, as described above, is through
key mappings.

For example, to initiate a buffer search, use the command `:Scope Buffer` or
`:Scope buffer`. Typing `:Scope <Tab>` will display all available functions.

`Grep` takes additional arguments. `:Scope {Grep|grep} [dir] [str]` starts a
live search with 'str' as the initial search string if non-empty. If 'dir' is
specified, search in that directory instead of the current directory.

You can map these commands to keys also. For example:
>
	nnoremap <your_key> <cmd>Scope File<cr>

Key Mappings ~

When popup window is open the following key mappings can be used.

`<Right>/<PageDown>`     Page down
`<Left>/<PageUp>`        Page up
`<tab>/<C-n>/<Down>/<ScrollWheelDown>`	Next item
`<S-tab>/<C-p>/<Up>/<ScrollWheelUp>`	Previous item
`<Esc>/<C-c>`            Close
`<CR>`                   Confirm selection
`<C-j>`                  Go to file selection in a split window
`<C-v>`                  Go to file selection in a vertical split
`<C-t>`                  Go to file selection in a tab
`<C-q>`                  Send all unfiltered items to the quickfix 
                       list (`:h quickfix.txt`)
`<C-Q>`                  Send only filtered items to the quickfix list
`<C-l>`                  Send all unfiltered items to the location
                       list (`:h location-list`)
`<C-L>`                  Send only filtered items to the location list
`<C-k>`                  During live grep, toggle between pattern search of
                       results and live grep.

Prompt window editor key mappings align with Vim's default mappings for
command-line editing.

`<Left>`                 Cursor one character left
`<Right>`                Cursor one character right
`<C-e>/<End>`            Move cursor to the end of line
`<C-b>/<Home>`           Move cursor to the beginning of line
`<C-u>`                  Delete characters b/w cursor and beginning of line
`<C-w>`                  Delete word before the cursor
`<S-Left>/<C-Left>`      Cursor one WORD left
`<S-Right>/<C-Right>`    Cursor one WORD right
`<C-Up>/<S-Up>`          Recall history previous
`<C-Down>/<S-Down>`      Recall history next
`<C-r><C-w>`             Insert word under cursor (<cword>) into prompt
`<C-r><C-a>`             Insert WORD under cursor (<cWORD>) into prompt
`<C-r><C-l>`             Insert line under cursor into prompt
`<C-r>` {register}       Insert the contents of a numbered or named register.
		       Between typing CTRL-R and the second character '"' will
		       be displayed to indicate that you are expected to enter
		       the name of a register.

2. Requirements					*scope-requirements*

- Vim >= 9.1

==============================================================================
3. Installation					*scope-installation*

Install using vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
>
	vim9script
	plug#begin()
	Plug 'girishji/scope.vim'
	plug#end()

Legacy script:
>
	call plug#begin()
	Plug 'girishji/scope.vim'
	call plug#end()

Install using Vim's built-in package manager.
>
	$ mkdir -p $HOME/.vim/pack/downloads/opt
	$ cd $HOME/.vim/pack/downloads/opt
	$ git clone https://github.com/girishji/scope.vim.git

Add the following line to your $HOME/.vimrc file.
>
	packadd scope.vim
<
==============================================================================
4. Configuration				*scope-configuration*

The appearance of the popup window can be customized using `borderchars`,
`borderhighlight`, `highlight`, `scrollbarhighlight`, `thumbhighlight`,
`maxheight`, `maxwidth`, and other `:h popup_create-arguments`. To wrap long
lines set `wrap` to `true` (default is `false`). To configure these settings,
use `scope#popup#OptionsSet()`.

For example, to set the border of the popup window to the `Comment` highlight
group:
>
	scope#popup#OptionsSet({borderhighlight: ['Comment']})

or,
>
	import autoload 'scope/popup.vim' as sp
	sp.OptionsSet({borderhighlight: ['Comment']})

Following highlight groups modify the content of popup window:

- `ScopeMenuMatch`: Modifies characters searched so far. Default: Linked to
			  `Special`.
- `ScopeMenuVirtualText`: Virtual text in the Grep window. Default: Linked to
			  `Comment`.
- `ScopeMenuSubtle`: Line number, file name, and path. Default: Linked to
			  `Comment`.
- `ScopeMenuCurrent`: Special item indicating current status (used only when
			  relevant). Default: Linked to `Statement`.

==============================================================================
5. Writing Your Own Extension				*scope-extension*

The search functionality encompasses four fundamental patterns:

1. Obtaining a List and Fuzzy Searching: ~
   - This represents the simplest use case, where a list of items is acquired,
     and fuzzy search is performed on them.

2. Asynchronous List Update with Fuzzy Search: ~
   - In scenarios like file searching, the list of all items is updated
     asynchronously while concurrently conducting a fuzzy search.

3. Dynamic List Update on User Input: ~
   - Certain cases, such as handling tags or Vim commands, involve waiting for
     a new list of items every time the user inputs something.

4. Asynchronous Relevant Items Update on User Input: ~
   - For dynamic searches like live grep, the list is updated asynchronously,
     but exclusively with relevant items, each time the user types something.

Representative code for each of these patterns can be found in
`autoload/scope/fuzzy.vim`.
